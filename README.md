# Nawo Assessment

This project was completed to prove that I am a good fit for the position of React Native intern at Nawo.

The assessment was about building a smooth home screen

I developed the home screen using the Expo version 51+

It is a single-screen mobile application that developed transits a design into code usage, `React Native` using the `Expo Go`

### To run the project:

Take the following steps to run the project and explore basic features implemented:

1. Get Project locally: To get the code locally on you machine, you'll need to clone or fork the project repo. To do this, go to the project's repo, then copy the https urls on GitHub then run, `git clone <https url copied>`

2. Install all dependencies: For the project to run without error, you need to install all dependencies using the command, `npm install`

3. By installing all dependencies, you can go on to explore everything implemented.

To easily know most features implemented and the programming skills showcased, I will briefly list some and important ones of them:

1. **Used bottom tab navigation:** This is to showcase my skill in React Native navigation. With this, I was able to create dummy screens for corresponding screens that are not required to be developed.

2. **Modular programming:** I made sure I break component code into small chunks where necessary. With this approach, I was able to easily reuse components.

3. **Folder structure:** Although, it was a small and simple project, I still kept in mind that this could be a big project. Hence, I maintained simple folder structure that can easily be navigated through.
