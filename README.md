# Nawo Assessment

This project was completed to prove that I am a good fit for the position of React Native intern at **Nawo**.

The assessment was about building a smooth home screen

I developed the home screen using the Expo version 51+

It is a single-screen mobile application that transits a design into `React Native` app, using the `Expo` and `Expo Go`

### To run the project:

Take the following steps to run the project and explore basic features implemented:

1. **Get Project locally:** To get the code locally on your machine, you'll need to clone or fork the project's repository. To do this,

- Go to the project's repository
- Copy the https urls on GitHub
- Go to your VSCode terminal
- Locate the folder you'd like to keep the project. If for example you want to have the project in `desktop` then you can change directory to desktop by running `cd desktop`
- Then run, `git clone <https url copied>`. This will make the project available on your machine , for example, the project will be in the desktop folder
- You can then go to the desktop folder and look for `Nawo__assessment` folder, then open it with your VSCode or any of your preferred IDE

2. **Install all dependencies:** For the project to run without error, you need to install all dependencies used for the project using the command, `npm install`

#### To easily know most features implemented and the programming skills showcased, I will briefly list some and important ones of them:

1. **Used bottom tab navigation:** This is to showcase my skill in React Native navigation. With this, I was able to create dummy screens for corresponding screens that are not required to be developed.

2. **Modular programming:** I made sure I divided components into small chunks where necessary. With this approach, I was able to easily reuse components.

3. **Folder structure:** Although, it was a small and simple project, I still kept in mind that this could be a big project. Hence, I maintained simple folder structure that can easily be navigated through.

4. **Total responsiveness:** The application is totally responsive on both portrait and landscape orientations.

5. **Splashscreen:** Introduced splash screen feature and used the provided splash screen in the design.

6. **Accessibility:** The application is accessible on both Android and iOS.

7. **Great attention to details:** Gave attention to every details in the design. Other than strictly following the colors provided by the design, I also strictly followed the typography provided and most importantly used the `Inter` font family as used in the design.
